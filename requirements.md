# Requirements Document: Parallax Scrolling Home Page

## Introduction
Add a new parallax scrolling home page that serves as an introduction to the Premium Store 3D website, featuring the most successful products. The page will use Apple's website design approach as inspiration, specifically their AirPods Pro page styling and interactions. This enhancement will be additive to the existing website functionality.

## Requirements

- IF the user navigates to the existing store THEN the system SHALL preserve all current website features unchanged

#### 1.2 Hero Section
**User Story:** As a potential customer, I want to see an engaging hero section with smooth parallax effects, so that I feel impressed by the premium nature of the products.

- IF a user hovers over a product THEN the system SHALL provide interactive feedback

#### 2.2 Product Information Integration
**User Story:** As a customer, I want to see key product details and pricing in the showcase, so that I can make informed decisions without leaving the home page.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- WHEN a product is displayed THEN the system SHALL show product name, key features, and price
- WHEN a user clicks on a featured product THEN the system SHALL navigate to the detailed 3D view in the existing store
- IF product data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display placeholder content gracefully

### 3. Visual Design and User Experience
#### 3.1 Apple-Inspired Aesthetics
**User Story:** As a user, I want the website to have a premium, Apple-like visual design, so that I perceive the products and brand as high-quality.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- WHEN the page renders THEN the system SHALL use clean typography, generous white space, and premium color schemes
- WHEN elements appear on scroll THEN the system SHALL use subtle, sophisticated animations
- IF the user has motion preferences disabled THEN the system SHALL respect reduced motion settings

#### 3.2 Responsive Design
**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the parallax home page to work smoothly on my device, so that I have a consistent experience across platforms.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- WHEN accessed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide optimized parallax effects or alternatives
- WHEN the viewport changes THEN the system SHALL adapt layouts and animations accordingly
- IF the device has limited performance THEN the system SHALL gracefully reduce complex animations

### 4. Performance and Technical Integration
#### 4.1 Loading Performance
**User Story:** As a user, I want the home page to load quickly despite rich visual effects, so that I don't abandon the site due to slow performance.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL achieve load times under 3 seconds on standard connections
- WHEN images are loading THEN the system SHALL show progressive loading or placeholders
- IF network conditions are poor THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical content loading

#### 4.2 Existing Code Integration
**User Story:** As a developer, I want the new home page to integrate seamlessly with existing code, so that current functionality remains unaffected.

**Acceptance criteria:**
